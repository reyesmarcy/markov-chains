Everyday when you're walking down the street,
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view

And I say HEY! what a wonderful kind of day.
Where you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other

You got to listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes, open up your ears
Get together and make things better by working together
It's a simple message and it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself (believe in yourself)
Well that's the place to start (to start)

And I say HEY! what a wonderful kind of day
Where you learn to work and play
And get along with each other
