When the sun shines we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath that I'm a stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh
Under my umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh
