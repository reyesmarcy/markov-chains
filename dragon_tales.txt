Emmy wished on a dragon scale
And that's what started Dragon Tales
Around the room the dragons flew
But Emmy and Max knew what to do
They climbed on the backs of their dragon friends
Now the adventures never end!
Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales
It's almost time for Dragon Tales
Come along and take my hand
Let's all go to Dragon Land
There's Org, he's the biggest
Not so brave of heart
There's Cassie
So shy, but so very smart
There's Zak and Wheezie and the tales of fun
Cause you know two heads are better than one
Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales
It's almost time for Dragon Tales
Come along and take my hand
Let's all go to Dragon Land
